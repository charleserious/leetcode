# [28. Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

## Description

Implement `strStr()`.

Return the index of the firxt occurence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

## Example 1

```example
Input: haystack = "hello" needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

## Example 2

```example
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

## Clarification

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an inteview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's `strstr()` and Java's `indexOf()`.

## Solution

```javascript

```
