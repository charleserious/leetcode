### Jewels and Stones

#### Description
You're given strings **J** representing the typs of stones that are jewels, and **S** representing the stones your have. Each character in **S** is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in **J** are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in **J** and **S** are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so **"a"** is considered a different type of stone from **"A"**ã€‚

#### Example 1:

Input: J = 'aA', S = 'aAAbbbb'
Output: 3
```
