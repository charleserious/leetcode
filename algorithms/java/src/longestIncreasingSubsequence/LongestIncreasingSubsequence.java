/**
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
 *
 * The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of a given subsequence
 * such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
 *
 * For example,
 * the length LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80}
 * is 6
 * and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}
